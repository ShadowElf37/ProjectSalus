Known bugs:
    1. persistent.py isn't saving data

=========
Backend (urgent):
    All done!

Front-end (important):
    1. Home page demo
    2. Create client-side password-request encryption when it's being sent to server (don't decrypt - it should be stored encrypted)
    3. Read/write lock account to avoid race conditions and reading/writing outdated information

Actual pages and functionality (less important):
    1. SGA feedback form & email forwarding system
    2. Snack polls
    3. Referendums / Surveys
    4. Announcements, Ma'amad info
    5. Public calendar with meetings & events
    6. Transcripts / summaries of meetings
    7. SGA's personal _todo list & easy way to add feedback to it
    8. Fancy home page
    9. User-friendly ways to edit all these
    10. Simple mass-email interface
    11. Remote access console and maintenance-in-progress backup system
    12. SSL
    13. Student life board?
    14. Push notifications?
    15. Student directory
    16. Sage menu
    17. Links to Blackbaud etc. - but easily accessible (maybe on the bottombar?)

Post-deployment wishlist (far future):
    1. Integration with other clubs and sports (calendar, push notifications, etc.)
    2. Mercury-style tutor/help board
    3. Mercury-style messaging (but more advanced please)
    4. Possibly replace Outlook with IMAP/SMTP because it's annoying
    5. Mercury currency for tutoring/trades?
