Back-end and essentials:
    - Basic web design CSS
    - IMAP
    - Scrape BB topics section for each class
    - Preserve updaters between reboots (specifically, store in a .dat the Updater.updatetime and make a bunch of new ones with that same updatetime on startup; they should run immediately if they're behind)
    - Prevent updaters from being generated willy-nilly on BB login if they already exist; stale updaters ought to be purged on logout
