Known bugs:
    1. persistent.py isn't saving data

=========
Backend (urgent):
    All done!

Front-end (important):
    1. Home page demo
    2. More helpful error handling - this is awful!
    3. Set navbar items for ranks 0-4 (guest, user, poster, admin, me)
    4. Create client-side password encryption when it's being sent to server (don't decrypt - it should be stored encrypted)

Actual pages and functionality (less important):
    1. SGA feedback form & email forwarding system
    2. Snack polls
    3. Referendums / Surveys
    4. Announcements, Ma'amad info
    5. Public calendar with meetings & events
    6. Transcripts / summaries of meetings
    7. SGA's personal _todo list & easy way to add feedback to it
    8. Fancy home page
    9. User-friendly ways to edit all these
    10. Simple mass-email interface
    11. Remote access console and maintenance-in-progress backup system
    12. SSL
    13. Student life board?
    14. Push notifications?

Post-deployment wishlist (far future):
    1. Integration with other clubs and sports (at least in the Calendar)
    2. Mercury-style tutor/help board
