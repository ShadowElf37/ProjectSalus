WIP:
- Email attachments
- Clear attachments on send
- Email Cc, Bcc
- Confirmation on submit

Considerations:
- Should remove the IMAP client page - it's way too much work to implement neatly, takes way too long to load, and generally isn't needed.
- The calendar should have an hourly view per-day, and a way to block off time for yourself, and add notifications - I want such functionality because I need a personal scheduling system lol.
- Classes view might be delayed to post-launch ...

Features:
- SGA feedback form
- Poll input types, store poll responses, default poll
- Announcements, Ma'amad info editors
- Public calendar with meetings & events
    - Hourly view
    - Add calendar items
    - SMS
- Transcripts / summaries of meetings
- SGA's personal _todo list & easy way to add feedback to it

Backend Work:

- Maintenance-in-progress backup system
- Store updater information for SMS scheduler, etc.
- Purge stale updaters for logged out people; generally overhaul session tokens with something more flexible
- Check dates of recently graded assignments
- Abstractify everything into configs so we only have to reboot in emergencies
- Randomized nice messages everywhere we normally see one (cf HandlerBBInfo "Have a lovely day!" etc.)
- SSL, Client-side encryption
