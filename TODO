Known Issues:
- 64 poison pills only kill 56 threads; sending 128
- Line 560 of scape.py 'schoolYearLabel' in grade scrape params - year needs to be dynamic
- Locked gradebook prevents teacher name from being fetched - need new source
- Newlines don't render in assignment descriptions landing.html
- XC will sometimes result in day null and no red, even if it's Saturday
- Long assignment titles will cut off all the other information


=======================
Alex's Todo List:
=======================

!!!!!! Make fileify work

- Ajax streaming for Well
- Well input autofocus after enter
=======================


WIP:
- Email attachments
- Clear attachments on send
- Email Cc, Bcc
- Confirmation on submit
- Class label on assignments

Considerations:
- Should remove the IMAP client page - it's way too much work to implement neatly, takes way too long to load, and generally isn't needed.
- Classes view might be delayed to post-launch ...
- XC breaks schedule when there's no class that day; also can't capture Shabbaton
- Let's fix up assignments to be separated by day and actually not suck

Next up:
- SMS with periods
- Phone number login
- Remove IMAP client
- Make sure schedule works
- Switch assignments by which class is highlighted
- Next class indicator cannot span days

Features:
- SGA feedback form
- Poll input types, store poll responses, default poll
- Announcements, Ma'amad info editors
- Public calendar with meetings & events
    - Hourly view
    - Add calendar items
    - SMS
- Transcripts / summaries of meetings
- SGA's personal _todo list & easy way to add feedback to it
- Simple mass-email interface
- Whitelist ranks, promotion command
- User settings and customization (delete, reload, etc.)
- Club integration
    - Calendar
- Bug reports

Backend Work:
- CSS, navbar
- Maintenance-in-progress backup system
- Store updater information for SMS scheduler, etc.
- Purge stale updaters for logged out people; generally overhaul session tokens with something more flexible
- Check dates of recently graded assignments
- Abstractify everything into configs so we only have to reboot in emergencies
- Randomized nice messages everywhere we normally see one (cf HandlerBBInfo "Have a lovely day!" etc.)
- SSL, Client-side encryption


Check for:
    - Bugs
    - Everything is html escaped
    - Remove TESTDATEs
